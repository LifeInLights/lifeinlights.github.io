*There are several ways to get involved in Life In Lights*

#Attend a workshop
Learn to create digital art along with computer programming skills. Workshops are targeted at beginners and will teach participants at any level what's needed to create beautiful pieces of digital art. 

#Contribute art
Whether you're a workshop attendee or an independent artist, we'd love to help you share the art you create with our community.

#Help with installations
Life In Lights will need plenty of help preparing and setting up installations throughout the city. There are ways to participate at any skill level; and you'll probably learn some valuable skills along the way.

#Get the word out
Let your friends know about the Life In Lights project. Share us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.

There really is something for everyone.
