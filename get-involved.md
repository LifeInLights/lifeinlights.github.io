#Host an installation
The Life In Lights project wants to help downtown business owners and property owners thrive. By hosting an installation property owners have the opportunity to draw attention to their location in a new and engaging way; increasing visitors, customers and potential real estate clients. If you are a property owner, tenant or know someone who would like to host an installation at their location, we'd love to speak with you!
