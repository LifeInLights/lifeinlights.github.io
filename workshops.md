*Workshops provide participants with an opportunity to learn how to create exciting and dynamic art.*

#What you'll learn
Learn to create art in a new and interesting way along with computer programming skills. Along the way, attendees learn the basics of computer programming and graphics.

Students will learn how to create dynamic computer generated artwork. Along the way they will learn some basics of computer programming and how to apply mathematics in computer graphics.

#Share what you've learned
With just a little bit of instruction and setup, students who bring their own computers will be able to leave the workshops prepared to create more artwork on their own after the workshop.

Once you're up and running, you'll be able to create just about anything you can imagine. Life In Lights is all about giving you a chance to share your creations as part of the city-wide installations.

#Attend an open-hours creativity session
In addition to our workshops, Leeds Theater will be hosting open-hours sessions every week to allow those interested in participating in creating art as well as creating art installations. These open hours will be lead by one of our organizers to provide assistance, feedback and answer any questions as you get your artwork ready to be shared with our community.

Open hours are Tuesday evenings from 6:00-9:00 at Leeds Center for the Arts (37 North Main St in downtown Winchester).

Feel free to drop in.
