*Workshops provide participants with an opportunity to learn how to create exciting and dynamic art.*

# What you'll learn
Students will create art in a new and interesting way by learning about dynamic computer generated artwork. Along the way they will learn some basics of computer programming, computer graphics and how science and math can be part of creating beautiful and imaginative art.

# Share what you've learned
With just a little bit of instruction and setup, students who bring their own computers will be able to leave the workshops prepared to create more artwork on their own after the workshop.

Once you're up and running, you'll be able to create just about anything you can imagine. Life In Lights is all about giving you a chance to share your creations as part of the city-wide installations.

# Attend a workshop
Workshops are open to all skill levels from beginners to experienced programmers and artists and will teach participants what's needed to create beautiful pieces of digital art.

The next workshop will be held March 12. [Details here!](/create-by-the-numbers)

# Attend an open-hours creativity session
In addition to our workshops, Leeds Theater will be hosting open-hours sessions every week to allow those interested in participating in creating art as well as creating art installations. These open hours will be lead by one of our organizers to provide assistance, feedback and answer any questions as you get your artwork ready to be shared with our community.

Open hours are Tuesday evenings from 6:00-9:00 at Leeds Center for the Arts (37 North Main St in downtown Winchester).

Open hours are casual. Feel free to drop in anytime on a Tuesday evening to learn, play, work and collaborate.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly at [lifeinlightswin@gmail.com](mailto:lifeinlightswin@gmail.com)
