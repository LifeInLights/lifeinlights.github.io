>&quot;There is light in the world, and it is us!&quot;

Life In Lights is a community focused art, education and livability project with a goal of bringing light and positive change to our downtown.

The Life In Lights project will transform vacant downtown storefronts into light based art installations; providing the community opportunities to come together to create and share engaging art.

Additionally, the Life In Lights provides workshops where participants will learn to create digital art along with computer programming skills. Workshops are targeted at beginners and will teach participants at any level what's needed to create beautiful pieces of digital art. 

You are invited to participate. See the [Get Involved](/get-involved) page or write to us at [lifeinlightswin@gmail.com](mailto:lifeinlightswin@gmail.com)
