>&quot;There is light in the world, and it is us!&quot;

**Visit the sidewalks of North Main Street in Downtown Winchester every evening between dusk to 10pm to experience dynamic community-created art and games.**

Life In Lights is excited to debut its second exhibit of community art titled *Be the Light* beginning March 3 on North Main Street in Downtown Winchester. *Be the Light* will feature new community art, including playful and interactive art installations.

The *First Light* exhibit, which continues its current run through Wednesday March 2, showcases vibrant digital artwork produced by local community members as part of Life In Lights and a series of free computer graphics programming workshops titled "Create: By the Numbers".

Life In Lights is a community-focused art, education and livability project with a goal of bringing light and positive engagement with our downtown. It transforms empty downtown storefronts into light based art installations; providing the community opportunities to come together to create and share engaging art.

You are invited to participate in Life In Lights. See [Get Involved](/get-involved), [Workshops](/workshops) to attend an upcoming free workshop or write to us at [lifeinlightswin@gmail.com](mailto:lifeinlightswin@gmail.com) to learn more!
